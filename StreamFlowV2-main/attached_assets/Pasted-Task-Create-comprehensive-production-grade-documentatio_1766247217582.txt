Task:
Create comprehensive, production-grade documentation for the StreamFlow SDK and API, based on the existing codebase.

Critical constraints:

DO NOT modify or refactor any existing demo code.

DO NOT change behavior of /api/session/* demo routes.

Documentation only — no code changes unless explicitly required to clarify types or comments.

Context:
StreamFlow is a real-time, pay-per-use streaming payment infrastructure using HTTP 402 (x402 pattern) and the Movement blockchain. The demo app shows the flow, but the SDK and /v1/* API are the actual product.

Audience:

Web3 app developers

Streaming platforms

Creator platforms

AI agents and pay-per-use services

They are integrating StreamFlow into their own apps.

Documentation Requirements

Generate documentation with the following structure:

1. Overview

Explain clearly:

What StreamFlow is (real-time payment infrastructure, not a streaming platform)

What problems it solves

Why HTTP 402 (x402) is used

How payments flow directly from viewer → creator

2. Core Concepts

Explain:

Sessions (start → active → stopped → settled)

Rate per second pricing

Payment accumulation model

Settlement via HTTP 402

Demo mode vs production mode (explicitly)

3. Architecture Overview

Include:

Demo App vs SDK vs Core API separation

Why the SDK does not sign transactions

How wallet signing is delegated to integrators

High-level flow diagram (ASCII or markdown)

4. SDK Installation

Document:

Installing @streamflow/sdk and @streamflow/shared

Environment requirements

Network assumptions (Movement testnet)

5. SDK Usage Guide

Step-by-step:

Initialize StreamFlowClient

Start a session

Track usage client-side

Stop a session

Handle HTTP 402 PaymentRequiredError

Sign and submit payment with a wallet

Retry settlement with X-PAYMENT header

Use pseudo-code or example snippets, but do not re-implement logic.

6. HTTP API Reference (/v1)

Document endpoints:

POST /v1/sessions/start

POST /v1/sessions/:id/stop

POST /v1/sessions/:id/settle

Expected request/response bodies

402 PaymentRequirements schema

7. Payment Flow (x402)

Explain:

Why HTTP 402 is returned

What PaymentRequirements contain

How clients should react

How settlement is verified on-chain

8. Demo vs Production Modes

Clearly document:

What is simulated in demo mode

What becomes real in production mode

Required environment variables

What happens if demo mode is disabled without wallets

9. Security & Trust Model

Explain:

Direct viewer → creator payments

No custodial funds

Server verification role

Why amount/recipient verification matters (mention as future hardening)

10. Who Should Use This SDK

Explicitly state:

This is for platforms and developers, not end users

Example use cases:

Live streaming

Study sessions

AI agent billing

Creator content

Metered APIs

11. FAQ / Common Integration Mistakes

Examples:

“Why doesn’t the SDK sign transactions?”

“Why am I getting HTTP 402?”

“Can I use my own pricing logic?”

“Can this work without crypto UI?”

Output Requirements

Produce the documentation as:

docs/README.md (main entry)

Optional sub-sections in markdown

Use clear, professional language

Treat this as payment infrastructure documentation, not a tutorial blog

Assume the reader is a competent developer
